# Pimcore 6 Project Skeleton 

This skeleton should be used by experienced Pimcore developers for starting a new project from the ground up. 
If you are new to Pimcore, it's better to start with our demo package, listed below ðŸ˜‰

## Getting started 
```bash
COMPOSER_MEMORY_LIMIT=-1 composer create-project pimcore/skeleton my-project
cd ./my-project
./vendor/bin/pimcore-install
```

- Point your virtual host to `my-project/web` 
- Open https://your-host/admin in your browser
- Done! ðŸ˜Ž

## Docker

You can also use Docker to setup a new Pimcore Installation:

```bash
COMPOSER_MEMORY_LIMIT=-1 composer create-project pimcore/skeleton my-project
cd ./my-project
docker-compose exec php vendor/bin/pimcore-install --mysql-host-socket=db
```
You can now navigate your browser to https://localhost or https://localhost/admin.
The default docker-compose comes with PHP7.4 on debian-buster and mariadb 10.4.
